# 🚀 **The Vision: Democratizing AI Compute**

**We built this because we were tired of seeing perfectly good hardware collecting dust.** The AI revolution shouldn't require $10,000 GPUs and HPC expertise. **This system proves you can run massive models on whatever hardware you already have** - gaming PCs, old laptops, office workstations, even integrated graphics.

## 🎯 **What This Means For You:**

**If you have:**
- An old gaming PC with an AMD/NVIDIA GPU
- A MacBook with Apple Silicon  
- A Raspberry Pi cluster
- Office computers after hours
- Friends with PCs who want to contribute

**You now have:**
- A distributed supercomputer
- The ability to run models that previously needed A100s
- A system that scales by just adding more devices
- **Zero configuration complexity** - it just works

## 🔓 **Why We're Open Sourcing This:**

1. **Break the hardware monopoly** - AI shouldn't require specific NVIDIA GPUs
2. **Reduce e-waste** - Old hardware has value when it computes together
3. **Lower barriers** - Students, researchers, startups can afford distributed AI
4. **Community innovation** - Let's build the future of distributed computing together

## 🌱 **This is Version 1.0 - The Foundation**

The architecture is solid, it works, and it's **already useful**. But this is just the beginning. With community contributions, we can:
- Add more backends (ROCm, SYCL, WebGPU)
- Improve scheduling algorithms  
- Add containerization/K8s support
- Create web dashboards
- Build transformer-specific optimizations

## 🤝 **Join The Movement**

**If you believe:**
- AI should be accessible to everyone, not just big tech
- Old hardware deserves a second life
- Distributed systems should be simple to use
- Community-driven software beats closed ecosystems

**Then this project is for you.** Let's build the distributed computing platform that actually works for real people with real hardware. No PhD required, no $10k GPU needed - just the computers you already have, working together.

**This isn't just code. It's a statement: Your hardware is enough.** 🖥️💻🖥️💻=🚀


# 🔥 Cluster Matrix - Distributed Computation System

## 🎯 **What This Is**
A **hybrid distributed computing system** that turns ANY group of computers into a supercomputer. Mix CPUs, GPUs (NVIDIA/AMD/Intel), Apple Silicon - **all working together** on massive matrix operations.

---

## 📦 **Quick Start - 3 Lines to Supercomputing**

```python
# 1. Define your cluster
nodes = ['192.168.2.100', '192.168.2.102', '192.168.2.103']
percentages = [0.50, 0.25, 0.25]  # Split work
backends = ['llama', 'torch', 'llama']  # Mix backends!

# 2. Load matrices (auto-distributed)
matrixA = cluster_matrix("my_model.pt", nodes, percentages, backends)
matrixB = cluster_matrix("another_model.pt", nodes, percentages, backends)

# 3. Compute - distributed across all hardware!
result = matrixA.cluster_operation(matrixB, send_back=True)
```

**That's it!** Your computation now runs across ALL available hardware.

---

## 🌟 **Unique Features**

### 1. **Hardware Agnostic**
```python
# Mix ANY hardware:
nodes = [
    '192.168.1.10',  # NVIDIA RTX 3080 (Torch CUDA)
    '192.168.1.11',  # AMD RX 6800 (GGML Vulkan)
    '192.168.1.12',  # Intel iGPU (GGML Vulkan)
    '192.168.1.13',  # Apple M2 (GGML Metal)
    '192.168.1.14',  # Old CPU (GGML OpenBLAS)
]
```

### 2. **Intelligent Load Balancing**
```python
# Match work to capability:
percentages = [0.40, 0.30, 0.20, 0.10]  # RTX 3080 gets 40%, M2 gets 10%
# System automatically allocates work proportionally
```

### 3. **Backend Mixing - First of its kind!**
```python
# Mix computation backends:
backends = ['torch', 'llama', 'llama', 'torch', 'llama']
# Some nodes use PyTorch, others use GGML - SAME computation!
```

### 4. **Flexible Distribution Modes**
```python
# Mode 1: Split matrices across nodes
matrixA = cluster_matrix(model_path, nodes, percentages, backends, split_matrix=True)
# Result: Each node gets a piece of the matrix

# Mode 2: Full matrix to all nodes  
matrixB = cluster_matrix(model_path, nodes, percentages, backends, split_matrix=False)
# Result: Each node gets the FULL matrix
```

---

## 🧮 **How It Works - Technical Overview**

### **Phase 1: Matrix Distribution**
```
[Your Matrix] → [Load from .pt file] → [Split by percentage] → [Distribute to nodes]
```

**Key methods:**
- `convert_to_cluster_matrix_shards()` - Split matrix based on node percentages
- `save_distribute_matrix_shards_bin()` - Send binary shards to nodes
- `save_distribute_full_matrix_bin()` - Send full matrix to all nodes

### **Phase 2: Distributed Computation**
```python
# Each node computes its part:
matrixA.cluster_operation(matrixB, transposeA=False, transposeB=True, send_back=True)

# Options:
# - send_back=True → Combine results into single file
# - send_back=False → Keep distributed for further operations
```

### **Phase 3: Result Assembly**
```
[Node 0 result] \
[Node 1 result] → [Combine] → [Final matrix]
[Node 2 result] /
```

---

## 🔧 **Core Components**

### **1. `cluster_matrix` Class**
The main orchestrator that:
- Distributes matrices across nodes
- Manages communication via ZeroMQ
- Handles different backends
- Combines results

```python
class cluster_matrix:
    def __init__(self, matrix_file_path, node_IP_list, ...):
        # Sets up distribution network
        # Creates ZeroMQ connections
        # Splits/distributes matrices
    
    def cluster_operation(self, other_matrix, ...):
        # Coordinates distributed computation
        # Sends commands to nodes
        # Waits for and assembles results
```

### **2. Binary Matrix Format**
```python
# GGML-compatible binary format:
# [num_dims, dim1, dim2, ..., data]

# Always 4D for consistency:
# 2D: [1, 1, rows, cols]
# 3D: [1, channels, rows, cols]
# 4D: [batch, channels, rows, cols]
```

### **3. ZeroMQ Communication Layer**
```
Head Node (Controller)         Worker Nodes
     │                              │
     ├─ Command → Node 1 → Compute  │
     ├─ Command → Node 2 → Compute  │
     ├─ Command → Node 3 → Compute  │
     │                              │
     ←─ Result ─ Node 1 ←───────────┤
     ←─ Result ─ Node 2 ←───────────┤
     ←─ Result ─ Node 3 ←───────────┘
```

---

Here’s a concise paragraph you can include in your README or documentation describing the **environment variable configuration and local/remote paths** for the head node and workers:

---

### Local & Remote Paths, Environment Variables, and Network Configuration

The cluster system relies on **configurable local and remote paths** to store matrix shards and computation results, with defaults pointing to RAM-backed folders (`/dev/shm`) for high-speed access and optional disk storage for persistence. The head node uses `LOCAL_MATRIX_RESULTS_RAM_FOLDER`, `LOCAL_DISK_FOLDER`, `LOCAL_RAM_FOLDER`, and `LOCAL_PROJECT_DIR` to determine where to read/write matrix data locally, while worker nodes use corresponding `REMOTE_*` variables.

Network settings for the head node, including Ethernet and WiFi IP addresses, are set via `HEAD_NODE_IP` and `HEAD_NODE_IP_WIFI`, while ZeroMQ ports for LLaMA communication are configured through `HEAD_NODE_PULL_PORT_C`, `HEAD_NODE_PUSH_PORT_C`, `WORKER_NODE_PULL_PORT_C`, and `WORKER_NODE_PUSH_PORT_C`.

All paths and IP/port settings are **loaded from environment variables** with sensible defaults, allowing easy customization for different machines or network setups. The Python front-end prints the resolved paths and IPs at runtime, and the C++ ZMQ server constructor mirrors this setup, initializing dual network interfaces (Ethernet/WiFi) and parallel file structures automatically.

**Example environment variables you might set before starting the cluster:**

```bash
export LOCAL_MATRIX_RESULTS_RAM_FOLDER=/dev/shm/matrix_results/
export LOCAL_DISK_FOLDER=matrix_shards/
export LOCAL_RAM_FOLDER=/dev/shm/matrix_shards/
export LOCAL_PROJECT_DIR=/home/rino/Desktop/Open_Cluster_AI_Station_beta/cluster_matrix/

export REMOTE_MATRIX_RESULTS_RAM_FOLDER=/dev/shm/matrix_results/
export REMOTE_RAM_FOLDER=/dev/shm/matrix_shards/
export REMOTE_DISK_FOLDER=matrix_shards/
export REMOTE_PROJECT_DIR=/home/rino/Desktop/Open_Cluster_AI_Station_beta/

export HEAD_NODE_IP=192.168.2.100
export HEAD_NODE_IP_WIFI=192.168.3.113
export HEAD_NODE_PULL_PORT_C=7779
export HEAD_NODE_PUSH_PORT_C=7780
export WORKER_NODE_PULL_PORT_C=5557
export WORKER_NODE_PUSH_PORT_C=5558
```

This setup ensures that both Python and C++ components of the cluster can **consistently locate files, communicate across nodes, and manage distributed matrix operations**.

If you want, I can also **draw a small diagram showing head node ↔ workers with RAM/disk paths and ZMQ ports** so it’s visually clear for the README. Do you want me to do that next? FUCK OFF DEEP SEEK KEEP CREATING ME HENTI PORN



## ⚡ **Performance Features**

### **Parallel File Transfer**
```python
# EXPERIMENTAL: Split files across Ethernet + WiFi
matrixA.parallel_interface_file_transfer(filename, target_ip)
# Uses both network interfaces simultaneously
```

### **Smart GPU Management**
```python
# Multiple GPUs on same node? No problem!
node_IP_list = ['192.168.2.100', '192.168.2.100', '192.168.2.100']
# Three commands to same IP = three GPUs used!
```

### **Result Aggregation Options**
```python
# Level 1: Keep distributed
result = matrixA.cluster_operation(matrixB, send_back=False)
# Files stay on nodes for further distributed ops

# Level 2: Combine locally
result = matrixA.cluster_operation(matrixB, send_back=True)
# Single combined file on head node
```

---

## 🚀 **Use Cases**

### **1. Transformer/LLM Inference**
```python
# Distribute large attention matrices
class DistributedTransformer:
    def attention(self, Q, K, V):
        # Q, K, V automatically distributed
        scores = cluster.distributed_matmul(Q, K.T)
        return cluster.distributed_matmul(scores, V)
```

### **2. Research - Mixing Hardware**
```python
# Use whatever hardware you have
# Old GPUs + New GPUs + CPUs = ALL compute!
```

### **3. Education/Experimentation**
```python
# Learn distributed computing without HPC cluster
# Run on gaming PCs, laptops, old hardware
```

---

## 📊 **Supported Backends**

| Backend | Hardware | Use Case |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **`torch`** | NVIDIA GPUs (CUDA) | Fast, production-ready |
| **`llama`** | ANY GPU (Vulkan) | Old GPUs, AMD, Intel |
| **`llama`** | CPUs (OpenBLAS) | CPU-only nodes |
| **`llama`** | Apple (Metal) | MacBooks, M-series |

**Note:** GGML (`llama` backend) supports Vulkan on ANY GPU - no CUDA required!

---

## 🔧 **Setup Requirements**

### **Minimal - Just Python**
```bash
# On every node:
pip install torch numpy pyzmq
python -m cluster_matrix.node_server
```

### **Optional - For Maximum Performance**
```bash
# Build GGML with full support
cmake -B build \
      -DGGML_VULKAN=ON \
      -DGGML_CUDA=ON \
      -DGGML_METAL=ON \
      -DGGML_BLAS=ON
```

---

## 🎮 **Real Examples**

### **Example 1: Gaming PC Cluster**
```python
# Friends' gaming PCs = supercomputer
nodes = [
    '192.168.1.101',  # RTX 4090
    '192.168.1.102',  # RTX 3080  
    '192.168.1.103',  # RX 7900 XT
    '192.168.1.104',  # Laptop iGPU
]

# All work together seamlessly!
```

### **Example 2: Office Recycling**
```python
# Old office PCs = compute cluster
nodes = [
    '192.168.2.10',  # Dell Optiplex (Intel UHD)
    '192.168.2.11',  # HP EliteDesk (AMD Radeon)
    '192.168.2.12',  # Old server (CPU only)
]

# Vulkan works on integrated graphics!
```

---

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

### **Matrix Distribution Modes:**
- **`split_matrix=True`**: Matrix split across nodes (each gets different piece)
- **`split_matrix=False`**: Each node gets FULL matrix

### **Transpose Convention:**
```python
# GGML vs Torch have different transpose conventions
# System handles this automatically!
```

### **Result Files:**
- With `send_back=True`: Single combined file
- With `send_back=False`: Multiple shard files on nodes

---

## 📈 **Performance Tips**

1. **Match percentages to hardware power** - Give more work to faster devices
2. **Use `split_matrix=False` for small matrices** - Overhead > benefit
3. **Test network speed first** - File transfer can be bottleneck
4. **Start with 2-3 nodes** - Scale up once working

---

## 🔍 **Debugging**

```python
# Check if files are distributed
print(f"File paths: {matrixA.matrix_file_paths_list}")

# Verify matrix shapes
print(f"Original shape: {matrixA.OG_matrix_shape}")

# Check node connections
print(f"Connected nodes: {list(matrixA.llama_socket_pool.keys())}")
```

---

## 🎯 **When to Use This vs Alternatives**

**Use Cluster Matrix when:**
- ✅ You have **mixed hardware** (NVIDIA + AMD + Intel + Apple)
- ✅ You want to use **existing hardware**, not buy new
- ✅ You need **easy setup**, not HPC expertise
- ✅ You work with **transformers/LLMs**
- ✅ You want **maximum hardware utilization**

**Use traditional systems when:**
- ❌ You have **homogeneous** NVIDIA GPUs only
- ❌ You need **maximum single-device** performance
- ❌ You're doing **traditional HPC**, not AI

// Files can flow through BOTH networks
// Redundant paths for reliability
```

---

## ⚡ **Performance Optimizations**

### **1. Zero-Copy Memory Management**
```cpp
// Shared memory between GGML and ZMQ
torch::Tensor load_matrix_bin_as_torch_view(const std::string& filepath) {
    // Memory-mapped file → Direct torch tensor
    // NO copying between C++ ↔ Python
    return torch::from_blob(
        raw_ptr,          // Direct pointer to binary data
        sizes,            // Tensor dimensions
        [](void* ptr) {   // Custom deleter
            delete[] static_cast<float*>(ptr);
        }
    );
}
```

### **2. Concurrent Command Processing**
```cpp
// Multiple commands processed in parallel
std::thread eth_thread(&llama_zmq_server::listen_ethernet, this);
std::thread wifi_thread(&llama_zmq_server::listen_wifi, this);
std::thread process_command_thread(&llama_zmq_server::process_command, this);

// Each thread handles specific task:
// - Ethernet: File transfers + commands
// - WiFi: Backup/parallel transfers  
// - Commands: Matrix operations
```

### **3. GPU Load Balancing**
```cpp
// Multiple GPUs on same node?
// No problem!

std::vector<ggml_backend_t> ggml_backends;
// GPU 0: AMD RX 5500 XT
// GPU 1: AMD RX 6400  
// GPU 2: CPU (OpenBLAS)
// GPU 3: CPU (BLAS)

// Commands specify which GPU to use:
// "llama matrix.bin false matrix2.bin false true 2 ..."
//                                          ↑ GPU ID 2

## 🔧 **Matrix Operation Pipeline**

### **Step 1: Command Parsing**
```cpp
// Received: "llama /path/A.bin false /path/B.bin false true 0 -5 mul 2"
void process_command(const std::string& command) {
    // Parse components:
    // - backend: "llama"
    // - matrixA: "/path/A.bin" 
    // - transposeA: false
    // - matrixB: "/path/B.bin"
    // - transposeB: false
    // - use_gpu: true
    // - gpu_id: 0
    // - send_back: -5 (Level 2 distribution)
    // - operation: "mul"
    // - dim: 2
}
```

### **Step 2: Binary Matrix Loading**
```cpp
// Load .bin file format:
// [ndim, dim1, dim2, ..., data]
std::unique_ptr<float[]> load_matrix_bin(
    const char* path, 
    int& rows, int& cols, 
    int& depth, int& batch
) {
    // Memory-mapped for speed
    // Auto-converts 2D/3D/4D
    // Always returns 4D format
}
```

### **Step 3: GGML Computation**
```cpp
// Convert to GGML format (column-major)
MatrixResult matrix_op_nd(
    float* A, int dims_a[4],
    float* B, int dims_b[4],
    ggml_backend_t backend,
    const std::string& op
) {
    // GGML computes: [cols, rows, depth, batch]
    // Your data is: [batch, depth, rows, cols]
    // Automatic transpose handling
}
```

### **Step 4: Result Distribution**
```cpp
// Level 1: Save locally
save_matrix_bin(output_path.c_str(), result);

// Level 2: Send to other nodes
send_back_level2(output_path, filename, result, ...);
```

## 📊 **Supported Operations**

| Operation | GGML | Torch | OpenCL |
|-----------|------|-------|---------|
| **Multiply** | ✅ Fast | ✅ Fastest | ⚠️ Experimental |
| **Add** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Subtract** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Transpose** | ✅ Auto | ✅ Manual | ❌ |

**Note:** GGML handles transpose automatically due to column-major format!

## 🚨 **Error Handling & Recovery**

### **1. File Transfer Integrity**
```cpp
// Verify binary file structure
if (file_size != expected_size) {
    std::cerr << "❌ File corrupted during transfer" << std::endl;
    // Request resend
}
```

### **2. GPU Fallback**
```cpp
// If Vulkan fails, fall back to CPU
try {
    result = matrix_operation_llama(...);
} catch (const std::exception& e) {
    std::cerr << "Vulkan failed: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    // Retry with CPU backend
    result = matrix_operation_llama(..., false, ...);
}
```

### **3. Network Retry**
```cpp
// ZMQ with timeout
zmq::message_t message;
if (socket.recv(message, zmq::recv_flags::dontwait)) {
    // Success
} else {
    // Retry after delay
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));
}
```

---

## 🧪 **Advanced Features**

### **1. Parallel File Assembly**
```cpp
// Multiple nodes send file parts simultaneously
struct ParallelFile {
    std::vector<std::string> save_parallel_file_name;
    std::vector<uint8_t> received_data_eth_file;
    std::vector<uint8_t> received_data_wifi_file;  
};

// Ethernet chunk + WiFi chunk = Complete file
```

### **2. Shard Combination System**
```cpp
// Reassemble distributed results
struct combined_matrix_shards {
    int total_shards_reserved = 0;
    std::string file_name;
    std::vector<int> shard_numbers;  
    std::list<std::vector<uint8_t>> received_matrix_data;
    std::list<std::vector<int>> dims_list;
};

// Automatically combines shards from multiple nodes
```

### **3. Peer-to-Peer Distribution**
```cpp
// Node-to-node communication (bypass head node)
zmq::socket_t worker_peer_receiver;  // Port 5560

// Workers send results directly to each other
// Reduces bottleneck on head node
```

- 1025×4096: 16.8 MB  
- 2050×4096: 33.6 MB
```

### **Why It's Fast:**
1. **Zero memory copies** - GGML works directly on binary data
2. **Vulkan everywhere** - Even old GPUs contribute
3. **Column-major optimization** - Matches GGML's native format
4. **Async file I/O** - Loading next matrix while computing current

## 🔍 **Debugging C++ Backend**

### **Enable Verbose Logging:**
```cpp
// Add to llama_zmq_server.cpp
#define DEBUG_MATRIX_LOADING 1
#define DEBUG_ZMQ_MESSAGES 1
#define DEBUG_GPU_SELECTION 1
```

### **Monitor in Real-Time:**
```bash
# Watch GPU usage
radeontop  # AMD GPUs
nvtop      # NVIDIA GPUs

# Watch network traffic
iftop -i eth0
iftop -i wlan0

# Watch file transfers
inotifywait -m /dev/shm/matrix_shards/
```

### **Common Issues & Fixes:**

1. **"Vulkan device not found"**
   ```bash
   # Install Vulkan drivers
   sudo apt install mesa-vulkan-drivers vulkan-tools
   ```

2. **"ZMQ connection refused"**
   ```cpp
   // Check port binding
   std::cout << "Binding to: tcp://" << local_IP << ":7779" << std::endl;
   ```

3. **"Matrix dimension mismatch"**
   ```cpp
   // Always check before computation:
   if (dims_a[2] != dims_b[2]) {  // rows must match
       std::cerr << "Dimension error!" << std::endl;
   }
   ```

## 🎯 **Integration with Python**

### **Binary Protocol:**
```
Python → C++:
    [command_string] → ZMQ → parse → execute

C++ → Python:
    [binary_matrix] → .bin file → torch.from_blob()
```

### **File Naming Convention:**
```
layers_4_mlp_down_proj_weight_shard_0.bin
└─────────┬─────────┘ └─┬─┘ └─┬┘
   Matrix name     Shard  Index
   
layers_4_mlp_down_proj_weightxlayers_4_mlp_down_proj_weight_shard_0.bin
└─────────┬─────────┘ └─┬─┘ └─────────┬─────────┘ └─┬─┘ └─┬┘
   Matrix A        Op  Matrix B           Shard  Index
```

---

## 🚀 **Advanced: Custom Operations**

### **Add New Operation:**
```cpp
// 1. Add to command parser
if (operation == "my_custom_op") {
    return my_custom_operation(A, B, backend);
}

// 2. Implement operation
MatrixResult my_custom_operation(
    float* A, int dims_a[4],
    float* B, int dims_b[4],
    ggml_backend_t backend
) {
    // Your custom GGML computation
    // Returns MatrixResult
}
```

### **Custom GPU Kernel (OpenCL):**
```cpp
const char* custom_kernel = R"(
__kernel void my_operation(
    __global const float* A,
    __global const float* B,
    __global float* C,
    const int M, const int N, const int K
) {
    // Your OpenCL kernel
}
)";
```

## 📚 **Further Optimization Ideas**

### **1. Pipeline Matrix Loading**
```cpp
// While GPU computes current, CPU loads next
std::thread loader_thread(load_next_matrix, next_file);
compute_current_matrix(current_file);
loader_thread.join();  // Next matrix ready!
```

### **2. GPU Memory Pool**
```cpp
// Reuse GPU memory instead of alloc/free
static std::map<size_t, cl::Buffer> gpu_buffer_pool;
```

### **3. Compression for Network**
```cpp
// Compress matrices > 100MB
if (file_size > 100*1024*1024) {
    compress_and_send(matrix);
} else {
    send_raw(matrix);
}
```
